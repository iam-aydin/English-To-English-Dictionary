Hey it's Aydin

I made this English to English dictionary as a hobby project. It’s got a bunch of words and definitions in it, so you can learn new stuff and sound smarter when you talk. It’s super easy to use - just type in the word you want and boom! You get the definition. It’s great for students, professionals, or anyone who wants to learn new words and impress their friends.

Teachers can use it too, to help their students get better at writing and stuff. And if you’re a writer or editor or translator, this thing is gonna be your new best friend. Seriously, it’s awesome.

I’m really proud of this project and I think it’s gonna help a lot of people get better at English. So check it out and let me know what you think
