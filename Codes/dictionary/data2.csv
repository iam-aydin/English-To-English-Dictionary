Gregg,"428 U.S. 153 (1976), upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty for first-degree murder as long as the individual character of the offender and the circumstances of the crime are taken into account. A two-part proceeding was thus required, one to determine guilt or innocence, and another to determine the sentence. Opponents of a Georgia death penalty statute had claimed that it violated Eighth Amendment guarantees against cruel and unusual punishment. However, the Supreme Court found that the statute contained sufficient guidelines regarding jury deliberation and discretion to enable the law to be imposed without constituting arbitrary or discriminatory application. In two related cases decided the same day, the Court cautioned against states requiring mandatory death sentences for certain crimes, since such a requirement precluded the possibility of considering mitigating circumstances.

Malloy,"378 U.S. 1 (1964), extended the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination to criminal defendants in state courts. Previously �pleading the Fifth,� i.e., choosing to remain silent in the course of a criminal investigation or trial, was reserved only for federal defendants. In this case, involving a Connecticut gambler who was charged with contempt for refusing to identify the owner of a pool hall, the Court used the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to extend the provisions of the Fifth Amendment to the states, thus expanding the rights of all criminal defendants. Five years later in Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784 (1969), the Court used the same process to extend the guarantee against double jeopardy to state defendants. "
